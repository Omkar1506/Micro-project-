    <p class="low ">A liver transplant surgery is recommended when the liver gets damaged, and it is beyond the bodyâ€™s regenerative capacity to repair and heal. It is generally performed when there is liver failure due to tumours, scarring of the tissues within the liver, liver diseases, or general diseases. The reasons for liver transplant surgery vary depending on the age of the patient.</p>
