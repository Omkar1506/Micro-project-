    <p class="para">Critical Care medicine is of vital importance for a healthy nation. This speciality will certainly reduce the mortality by providing early and appropriate life-saving interventions to all critically ill patients. <br><br><br> We offer 24/7 care to patients in potentially life-threatening conditions who need continuous monitoring to be carried out by a multidisciplinary team. Such situations arise in case of haemodynamic instability (hypertension/ hypotension), airway or respiratory compromise (such as ventilator support), acute renal failure, potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias, the cumulative effects of multiple organ system failure, or even in the crucial hours after major surgeries when the patient is deemed too unstable to transfer to a less intensively monitored unit. <br></p>
