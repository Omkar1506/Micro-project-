    <h4 class="h4">Key Procedures</h4>
    <p class="para2">Aorta Surgery
        Aortic valve surgery includes aortic valve repair, or valve replacement treatment, to fix a faulty aortic valve. The aorta distributes blood throughout the body, the aortic valve lets blood flow from the left lower chamber to the left ventricles to the aorta.
        
        Narayana Health has the facility to perform any type of aorta surgery - open and percutaneous.
        
        The aortic valve replacement is an open-heart surgery, operated to remove damaged valves and replace it with a new valve made from animal tissue or synthetic materials. The aortic valve replacement is necessary to be replaced in patients whose valves become narrow ( aortic stenosis) or the valve is leaky (aortic regurgitation). This type of heart surgery is risky and only a few health institutions have a high success rate in India. Narayanaâ€™s health Cardiology department has highly specialized and experienced aortic valve surgeons to give another life for thousands of patients through aortic valve replacement treatment.</p>
